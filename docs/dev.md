## Working on the code

Clone and install the project:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Pomax/use-models-for-data.git
$ cd use-models-for-data
$ npm install
```

The library code can be found in the `lib` directory, and the tests can be found in the `test` directory.

To run the tests, either run all tests in one go using:

```
$ npm test
```

Or look at the "scripts" section of the `package.json` file for which specific npm script to run if you just want to run a specific test file.
